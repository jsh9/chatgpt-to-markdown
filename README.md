# chatgpt-to-markdown

This is a Chrome and Edge extension to download the ChatGPT Q&A page into a markdown file.

## 1. Installation

To install it from the Chrome Web Store, go to this URL: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-to-markdown/ajogklnjecgpjfalkokkencdlbnhiohb

(Extensions on the Chrome Web Store can also be directly installed to Edge too.)

Alternatively, if you'd like to use this extension in the developer mode, following the steps below to install it:

1. Download this extension. You can choose either options:
    * Download the latest stable release from the [Releases](https://github.com/jsh9/chatgpt-to-markdown/releases) page
    * Clone this repository (which may contain newer-than-stable features). [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) is how to clone a Github repository.

2. Manually load the downloaded/cloned files into the browser:
    * [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked)
    * [Edge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/getting-started/extension-sideloading)

## 2. How to use

Navigate to ChatGPT, and to the conversation that you'd like to save as markdown.

Then click on the icon of this extension, or use the following keyboard shortcut:
- Windows and Linux: `Alt + Shift + 5`
- macOS: `Option + Shift + 5`

A markdown file will automatically be saved to your `Downloads` folder.

## 3. Local debugging and testing (for developers)

You can clone this repository, make small tweaks to it (if you code Javascript) as you'd like.

### 3.1. Building the project

To install and lock the dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install
```

To build the code, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

### 3.2. Testing

To run unit tests, first install dependencies, and then:

```bash
npx jest
```

### 3.3 Auto-format code

Run this command in the terminal:

```bash
npm run auto-format
```

And then check the file diffs.

### 3.4. CI/CD

Every pull request will trigger a CI/CD pipeline run, the steps of which are defined in [`./.github/workflows/pipeline.yml`](./.github/workflows/pipeline.yml).

The pipeline automatically checks for the following:
- The package version (in `package.json`) is consistent with the locked-down version (in `package-lock.json`)
- Versions in `manifest.json` and `package.json` are consistent
- The unit tests can all pass
- The minified script in `dist` is up to date with the code in `src`
- The code sytles are correct (running [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) does not product any file diff)
