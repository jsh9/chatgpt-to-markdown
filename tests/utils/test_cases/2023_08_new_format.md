# _Question_

Which number is bigger?  1234^5678 or 5678^1234?

# _Answer_

To determine which number is larger, $1234^{5678}$ or $5678^{1234}$, we can use logarithms.

Let's compare the natural logarithms (ln) of the two numbers:

A = ln($1234^{5678}$)
B = ln($5678^{1234}$)

Using the properties of logarithms, these become:

A = 5678 * ln(1234)
B = 1234 * ln(5678)

Now, let's compute each value:

A ≈ 5678 * 7.118016 = 40405.28
B ≈ 1234 * 8.644121 = 10672.68

Clearly, A is much larger than B.

This means that the logarithm of $1234^{5678}$ is much larger than the logarithm of $5678^{1234}$. Since the natural logarithm function is increasing, this means $1234^{5678}$ is larger than $5678^{1234}$.
