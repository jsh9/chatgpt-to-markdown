## Question

Which number is bigger?  1234^5678 or 5678^1234?

## Answer

To determine which number is larger, 123456781234^{5678}12345678 or 567812345678^{1234}56781234, we can use logarithms.

Let's compare the natural logarithms (ln) of the two numbers:

A = ln(123456781234^{5678}12345678)
B = ln(567812345678^{1234}56781234)

Using the properties of logarithms, these become:

A = 5678 * ln(1234)
B = 1234 * ln(5678)

Now, let's compute each value:

A ≈ 5678 * 7.118016 = 40405.28
B ≈ 1234 * 8.644121 = 10672.68

Clearly, A is much larger than B.

This means that the logarithm of 123456781234^{5678}12345678 is much larger than the logarithm of 567812345678^{1234}56781234. Since the natural logarithm function is increasing, this means 123456781234^{5678}12345678 is larger than 567812345678^{1234}56781234.
