        <p>Sure, here's an example of a text with normal text and markdown block quotes:</p><blockquote><p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to easily format text with simple syntax. It's widely used for creating documents, web pages, and even books.</p><p>With Markdown, you can use symbols like asterisks and hashes to create headings, bold and italic text, and lists. You can also add links, images, and even code snippets with ease.</p><blockquote><p>Block quotes are another useful feature of Markdown. They allow you to quote text from another source, such as an article or book, and make it stand out from the rest of your text. To create a block quote, simply add a ">" symbol at the beginning of each line you want to quote.</p><p>Block quotes can also be nested, so you can quote text within a quote. This can be useful for citing multiple sources or adding commentary to a quote.</p></blockquote><p>Overall, Markdown is a versatile and easy-to-use markup language that can save you a lot of time and effort when creating documents and web content.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Yes, you can definitely use block quotes between normal text. Here's an example:</p><p>If you're interested in learning more about programming languages, there are many great resources available online. One of the best places to start is with an introductory course or tutorial.</p><blockquote><p>"Learning to program is like learning a new language; it takes time and practice to become fluent." - Bill Gates</p></blockquote><p>It's important to choose a programming language that suits your goals and interests. Some popular languages include Python, JavaScript, and Java. Each language has its own strengths and weaknesses, and is used for different types of projects.</p><blockquote><p>"I think the best way to learn programming is by writing code." - John Carmack</p></blockquote><p>To become proficient in a programming language, it's important to practice regularly and work on projects that interest you. Don't be afraid to make mistakes and learn from them.</p><blockquote><p>"The only way to do great work is to love what you do." - Steve Jobs</p></blockquote><p>With dedication and perseverance, you can become a skilled programmer and open up new career opportunities.</p>
