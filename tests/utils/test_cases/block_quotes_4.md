## Question

Can you create an unordered list with block quotes in it?

## Answer

I can create an example for you using Markdown syntax, which is commonly used on platforms like GitHub and Reddit. In Markdown, you can create an unordered list with block quotes like this:

```css
- > Block quote 1
- > Block quote 2
- > Block quote 3
```

When rendered, it will look like this:

-
   > Block quote 1
   >

-
   > Block quote 2
   >

-
   > Block quote 3
   >

If you want to use this format in a specific context, please let me know so I can provide more accurate guidance.
