## Answer

Sure, here's an example of a bullet list with markdown block quotes in some of the bullets:

- Introduction

- Benefits of using markdown:

   > "Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write simple, easy-to-read text that can be easily converted to HTML or other formats. It's easy to learn and use, and can save you time and effort when creating documents, emails, or web pages."
   >

- Basic syntax:

   > "Markdown uses simple, intuitive syntax for formatting text. For example, you can use asterisks or underscores to create bold or italic text, or create headers using hashtags (#)."
   >

- Advanced syntax:

   - Links and images
   - Lists
      > "You can create ordered and unordered lists using simple syntax. Lists can be nested to create sub-lists as well."
      >

   - Code blocks and inline code
      > "Markdown allows you to easily include code snippets in your text. You can use backticks to create inline code, or use triple backticks to create a code block."

I hope this example helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
