## Question

Can you generate the following text: it has 4 bullet points.  The 1st bullet points should contain some texts that are bold, some texts that are italic, and some texts that are inline code.  The 2nd bullet point should contain a table.  The 3rd bullet point should contain 2 code blocks with some texts in between.  The last (4th) bullet point should have 3 levels of nested bullets (with the 2nd level being an ordered list item).

## Answer

Sure, here is the text you requested:

- The first bullet point contains some **bold text**, some _italic text_, and some `inline code`.
- The second bullet point contains a table:

| Column 1 Header | Column 2 Header | Column 3 Header |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Row 1, Column 1 | Row 1, Column 2 | Row 1, Column 3 |
| Row 2, Column 1 | Row 2, Column 2 | Row 2, Column 3 |
| Row 3, Column 1 | Row 3, Column 2 | Row 3, Column 3 |

- The third bullet point contains two code blocks:

```scss
def my_function():
    print("Hello World!")
```

Some text between the code blocks.

```scss
my_function()
```

- The fourth bullet point has three levels of nested bullets:

   - First level bullet point
      1. Second level ordered bullet point
      2. Second level ordered bullet point

   - First level bullet point
      - Second level bullet point
         - Third level bullet point
         - Third level bullet point
