## Question

Can you generate a table where some of the cells have bold texts, some have italic, some have inline code, some have hyperlinks, and some have strikethrough texts?

## Answer

Yes, I can generate such a table for you. Here's an example:

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Bold Text** | _Italic Text_ | `Inline Code` |
| [Link Text](https://example.com) | ~~Strikethrough Text~~ | Normal Text |

In this table, the first row has bold text, italic text, and inline code. The second row has a hyperlink, strikethrough text, and normal text.
